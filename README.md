# AssignmentsNG

This repository contains some of the individual assignments of my data science course in IIITB.

There are reasonable amount of comments in the source code to understand the flow and decisions made.

Strongly discourage the studens of IIITB to incorporate the part/sections of code as-is as a part of your assignments as it defeats the purpose of paying such large money to a course, but not going through the rigours the course demanded.

Neverthless, feel free to refer/use the code as needed. I am not sharing the datasets for these assignments as they are proprietary to Upgrad/IIITB.

Hoping to upload the python versions and SparkR versions as soon as I work on them here.

Happy coding and learning..
